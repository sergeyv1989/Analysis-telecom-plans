# Telecommunication plans analysis

In this project I will analyze the behavior of the clients of the telecommunications operator Megaline. 

The data is compiled from the cellular and internet communications of 500 clients during 2018. It includes the dates and durations of their calls, the dates and data volumes of their internet sessions, and the dates of their messaging. In addition we will use the personal details of the users, and finally the payment details of their communication plans.

The main goal of the steps is to find out which of 2 plans, "Surf" or "Ultimate", is more profitable, in order to advertise them accordingly.

The main steps will be:
- Exploring the data to learn its contents and to identify issues with its quality that should be addressed.
- Preparing the data for analysis by treating the discovered issues and calculating variables of interest in preparation for analysis, especially the revenues from the customers.
- Analyzing the data to study the differences in the communication consumptions of the users of the 2 plans.
- Testing hypotheses regarding the difference between the mean revenues from the users of the 2 plans, and from the users residing in the NY-NJ area versus those who live outside of it.
- Summarizing the overall findings.
